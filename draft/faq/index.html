<h2 id="what-are-conventions">What are conventions?</h2>
<p>They're intended as my recommended defaults for pick-up group play.
They aren't rules, and they aren't intended as the be-all-end-all.
They're just a baseline set of expectations that groups on PF can opt into.</p>
<h2 id="why-have-conventions">Why have conventions?</h2>
<p>Pick-up groups on North American data centers are notoriously inconsistent.
Some quotes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>saying that you are using &quot;PF strats&quot; has as much weight as the statement &quot;I have read and agreed to the terms and conditions to this software&quot;</p>
<p>because I'm gonna join and realize you don't even have PF strats, just a vague idea of where you're supposed to stand that might work</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>now imagine if a PF says JP strats but it means &quot;one out of four existing strats&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Like in p5s as a ranged on each party I have to stand somewhere different in Ruby5 and nobody tells me until I wipe us</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This isn't to say that PF play on other DCs is a wonderful paradise where everyone clears first try.
They aren't. Trap parties are still a thing.</p>
<p>But some of this, like having many different strats all with the same name, feels like an own goal.
Conventions are one way that we can reduce inconsistency across PF listings on Dynamis.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-use-conventions">How do I use conventions?</h2>
<p>Right now, just do your best to follow them and hope others do the same. There
might be more later.</p>
<h2 id="macros-are-too-small-i-can-t-read-them">Macros are too small. I can't read them!</h2>
<p>You can adjust the text size for your chat windows by clicking the cog icon along the bottom bar and then switching to the &quot;Log Details&quot; tab.</p>
<p>You may also need to enlarge your chat window so that macros don't get wrapped across lines, as this will ruin the visual layout. You can use the &quot;Zoom Log Window&quot; button/keybind in order to do this temporarily, which can be very helpful.</p>
