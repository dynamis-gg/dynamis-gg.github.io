## What are the DESU conventions?

They're our recommended defaults for pick-up group play.
They aren't rules, and they aren't intended as the be-all-end-all.
They're just a baseline set of expectations that groups on PF can opt into.

## Why have conventions?

Pick-up groups on North American data centers are notoriously inconsistent.
Some quotes:

> saying that you are using "PF strats" has as much weight as the statement "I have read and agreed to the terms and conditions to this software"
> 
> because I'm gonna join and realize you don't even have PF strats, just a vague idea of where you're supposed to stand that might work

> now imagine if a PF says JP strats but it means "one out of four existing strats"

> Like in p5s as a ranged on each party I have to stand somewhere different in Ruby5 and nobody tells me until I wipe us

This isn't to say that PF play on other DCs is a wonderful paradise where everyone clears first try.
They aren't. Trap parties are still a thing.

But some of this, like having many different strats all with the same name, feels like an own goal.
Conventions are one way that we can reduce inconsistency across PF listings on Dynamis.

## How do I use conventions?

Just put "DESU conventions" in your PF listing and have a link handy to explain to anyone who isn't familiar with them!

Outside of parties in the DESU server, don't assume that parties follow DESU conventions.
Though it's perfectly fine to join a party and suggest them.

## Macros are too small. I can't read them!

You can adjust the text size for your chat windows by clicking the cog icon along the bottom bar and then switching to the "Log Details" tab.

You can also enlarge the chat window temporarily to read a macro. If you're using a gamepad, you can select the chat window and press the jump button to enlarge it to the full screen temporarility. On keyboard, and mouse, you can drag the chat window from the corner to enlarge it, then put it back when you're done reading.

## These are super cool, how do I meet more cool people who like these?

## Or: These are mega-awesome-super-cool, how do I help out?

## Or: One or more of your conventions sucks. I have Opinions. Where do I rant about them?
