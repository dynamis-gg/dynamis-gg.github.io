These etiquette conventions set out suggested standards for parties hosted on Dynamis.
While these are not rules, we ask all DESU members to follow them when playing in pickup groups.

## 0. Be prepared when joining a party

This is rule 0 because it's the most important.

When joining a party, make sure to *read* the party description, and don't join the party if you are not prepared for it.

Don't join a party progging a particular mechanic if you can't consistently clear earlier mechanics in the fight. If the party listing asks you to have familiarised yourself with the fight in advance, don't join blind.

On the flip side, if a party says newcomers welcome, don't be afraid to join even without experience.
You're explicitly invited!

If the posting lists a particular strat, familiarise yourself with it. If the party isn't close to filling, it's fine to join the party and ask the leader to share their macro so that you can make sure you understand it before joining the instance. If it's close to filling on a fast PF day, it might be better to ask in /tell so that you don't force everyone to wait for you to read/watch instructions on the strat.

It's always fine to /tell the leader asking for clarifications.

_Corollary:_ Party leaders should ensure that the posting is accurate, such as by setting the sprout icon/unsync icon when appropriate, and ensuring that their strat link/macro are actually the strats they're going to use.

_Corollary:_ Party leaders should feel comfortable to kick players who don't read the description or don't fit the posted requirements.


## 1. The party leader is ultimately responsible for strategy

If there is discussion or disagreement about strats, the party leader should call the shots by default.
The party leader can also designate someone else as the shot-caller in their place.
Any time alternative strategies are discussed, the shot-caller should make the call on what strategy will be followed, and be clear about it.

Why?

1.  The party leader controls the PF advertisement and therefore what people see before they join the party.
    Party members will join the party expecting the PF advertisement to be followed.
2.  Without one person clearly making decisions about which strats to use, the party may be confused about whether a new suggestion was agreed to.
    If a party goes into a pull with different ideas of the strats, then there is a good chance the pull is doomed and a complete waste of time.
    Most of the time, it is more important that there be a clear decision than that the decision be "correct".

When the leader already knows what strats they want to use,

* The leader should put strategy info in the PF description. There isn't really enough room for a detailed list of strats, so the name of a comprehensive strategy is preferred (e.g. "DESU strats"). If modifying a strat from the standard, indicate that (e.g. "DESU strats w/ variations").
* The leader should be prepared to link to resources explaining the strats.
* The leader should have a macro with a summary of the strats.

It is completely okay for the leader to be learning or relearning the fight and not know it.
Nobody should be upset at someone learning the fight for the first time!

Likewise, it's completely okay if the leader doesn't want to be the shot-caller, especially when learning the fight. But they should designate someone else to do it.

## 2. Ask questions.

If you are unclear about part of the strat, ask about it.

If the party wipes and you don't understand why, ask what happened.

If you die and you don't understand why, ask what killed you.

If someone doesn't seem to be following the strat, ask if they understand it.

On average, questions will save more time than they waste. It's okay to hit "No"
on a readycheck to ask a question.

_Corollary_: Don't get snippy at others for asking questions.

## 3. Claim positions in chat rather than doing a clock spot dance

Rather than placing a marker on the ground and the party positioning themselves around it, the party should claim positions in chat.
Specifically, tanks are `MT` (main tank) and `OT` (off-tank), healers are `H1` and `H2`, melee DPS are `M1` and `M2`, and ranged DPS are `R1` and `R2`.
If the party composition is different, players may have to overflow onto other roles' spots (most often a ranged DPS taking a melee spot).

{{ image(alt="A macro readout showing spread spots and light parties. The spread spots, clockwise from north, are: main tank, ranged 2, healer 2, melee 2, off-tank, melee 1, healer 1, ranged 1. The first light party has the main tank and healer and DPS 1; the second has the off-tank and healer and DPS 2.", src="spots.png", caption="Diagram of default positions") }}

The specific assignment of spread spots and light parties is often fight specific, designed to optimize for good melee uptime or particular mechanics.
If the party has a fight-specific macro, it will set out the spread spots and light parties, among other things.
If the party doesn't have a fight-specific macro, then the default positions are per the diagram (a macro for this diagram is available in the DESU server).

### 3a. Job priorities for positions

To speed things up, certain jobs have particular priorities for positions.
This is most significant for tanks, because of the mechanical differences between the tank jobs.
For other roles, the job priorities are mostly to speed up selection of positions and reduce the frequency of players having to play unfamiliar positions.
Note: someone wants a position other than the one suggested by these priorities, it is usually faster to just let them have that position than to argue about it.

For tanks, the main tank priority is WAR > DRK > GNB > PLD, based on their ability to sustain damage.
If the players have no preference, the tank whose job comes first in the list should be main tank by default.
The priority order may change after the Paladin rework in patch 6.3, and also on a fight-specific basis.

For healers, the priority is WHM > AST > SCH > SGE.
The healer whose job comes first in the list should be H1.
Generally this means that the pure healer will be H1 and the barrier healer will be H2.

For DPS, the ranged physical DPS should typically be R1 and the caster should be R2.
