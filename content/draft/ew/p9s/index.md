# Anabaeios: the Tenth Circle (Savage): Kokytos

## Recurring Mechanics

### Raidwides

There are two recurring raidwides through the fight: **Gluttony's Augur** and **Ravening/Soul Surge**.

**Gluttony's Augur** is a standard heavy damage raidwide with a 5 second cast time.
Every cast of **Gluttony's Augur**, except for the very first, occurs immediately after another mechanic.
A single 10-second mitigation can catch both the previous mechanic and the raidwide.

**Ravening** is used to start each [phase](#souls) of the fight.
It is a damageless cast with a 4 second cast time.
7 seconds after the cast completes, the boss uses **Soul Surge** with no castbar, dealing heavy raidwide damage.
10-second mitigations should not be used before the **Ravening** cast begins, and 5-second mitigations should not be used until it completes.

### Tankbusters

There are two recurring tankbusters; neither occurs in combination with any mechanic. Both require a tank swap.

**Duality of Death** is a two-hit AoE dual tankbuster.
On each hit, the boss will cast **Fire IV** on the player with the highest enmity, and **Aero IV** on the player with the second highest.
These inflict a *Fire Vulnerability* and *Wind Vulnerability* debuff, respectively, forcing a tank swap or for both tanks to use invulnerability.
Both hits are AoE and will hit any players nearby the tanks when they go off.

**Ascendant Fist** is a single-target tankbuster.
It inflicts both a *Bleed* and a *Physical Vulnerability* debuff.
The *Physical Vulnerability* will cause subsequent auto attacks to be lethal.
A tank swap or invulnerability is required.
**Ascendant Fist** is single-target, so there is no need to stand away from the tank.

For both tank swaps, the swap can occur during the castbar and the debuffs are not relevant to any other mechanics.

### Souls

The fight is divided into 6 distinct phases where the boss changes forms based on consumed souls.

Each soul begins with a cast of **Ravening**, which grants a buff indicating the current soul, e.g. *Soul of the Mage*.
The buff has no gameplay effect.
At the end of the phase, the boss will use **Disgorge**, a castless, damageless ability that causes it to return to its default form.
**Disgorge** will be immediately followed by **Ravening** to begin the next phase.

### Dualspell/Two Minds {#dualspell}

**Dualspell** is a combination donut and stack/spread mechanic used many times throughout the fight during the *Mage* phases.

When the boss is casting **Dualspell**, it will hold out its hands and two large glyphs of two elements will appear.
One element will always be ice (hexagonal glyph).
The second element will be either fire (triangular glyph) or thunder (square glyph).
The second element is always fixed at a particular point in the timeline and does not vary from pull to pull.

Once the boss finishes casting, one of the two glyphs will flash briefly on each player's screen, very largely.
This glyph determine which element is enhanced to have a bigger area of effect.
Then both elements' effects will go off simultaneously: the one with the glyph flash will be enhanced, and the one that did not flash will be the regular variation.

For **Ice**, the effect is a donut AoE.
In the enhanced ice attack, only the innermost circle of the arena (smaller than the boss's hitbox) is safe.
In the non-enhanced ice attack, the two innermost circles are both safe.

For **Fire**, the effect is four two-person stack AoEs that hit either all DPS or all supports.
If the fire attack is enhanced, then the AoEs will be larger, requiring more space between them.

For **Thunder**, the effect is eight line AoEs originating from the boss, one targeted to each player.
In the enhanced variation, the lines are significantly thicker, requiring the players to be spread further apart to avoid being hit by multiple.

Both elemental attacks inflict a brief *Magic Vulnerability* debuff, so a player must not be hit by more than one.

**Two Minds**, used during the *Chimera* phases, is identical to **Dualspell** except for two differences.
First, it has a substantially shorter cast time.
Second, the fire or thunder variant is chosen randomly at each cast, rather than being fixed.
Players must look at the boss's hands to determine which variant is being used.

### Archaic Rockbreaker

During two of the phaes, the boss will use **Archaic Rockbreaker**.

At the start of these phases, during the **Ravening** cast, four rectangular AoE telegraphs will appear near the edges of the area, at either the cardinal or intercardinal positions.
As the phase transitions, rock walls will appear in place of the telegraphs, killing any players caught in them.

Later in the phase, the boss will cast **Archaic Rockbreaker**.
During the cast, a knockback danger circle will appear underneath the boss.
**Shockwave** will be used with no castbar after **Archaic Rockbreaker** completes, killing anyone in the circle and knocking everyone else back with some damage.
The knockback will knock anyone not in front of a wall out of the arena, and cannot be ignored with knockback immunity.
Shockwave will also cause cracks to appear in the ground: 4 short cracks with ends inside the boss's hitbox, and 8 longer cracks with ends outside the boss's hitbox.

Immediately after the knockback, **Archaic Rockbreaker** itself will hit either the four DPS or four supports.
This is a fairly large 2-person stack AoE.
It is big enough that you can safely run towards the boss immediately after the knockback without escaping it.

As this happens, lights will appear under the boss and begin traveling along the cracks in the ground.
2 lights will travel slowly along the short cracks.
6 lights will travel quickly along the light cracks.
The pattern is fixed and only changes orientation.

During the first crack spread, the boss will begin using a different mechanic, depending on the phase.

When the lights reach the end of their cracks, they will all explode in circular AoEs.
Telegraphs will appear briefly before the AoEs detonate.
There is time to dodge the AoE after the telegraph appears.

After the first set of explosions, lights will appear in the remaining cracks, which travel outward and explode in the same manner.

## Phase 1: Mage 1

The boss begins by casting **Gluttony's Augur** followed by **Ravening** to begin the first *Mage* phase.

It will cast **Duality of Death** followed by three **Dualspell**: fire, thunder, and fire again.
The first and third uses of **Dualspell** will always flash alternate glyphs.
So if the first one has enhanced fire, the third will have enhnaced ice, and vice versa. 
Which glyph flashes on the second **Dualspell** is random.

## Phase 2: Martialist

The boss begins the *Martialist* phase with **Ravening** followed by **Ascendant Fist**.
Walls will appear during **Ravening** in preparation for **Archaic Rockbreaker**.

After the **Ascendant Fist** tankbuster, the boss will cast **Archaic Rockbreaker**.

After the knockbac, as the lights in the cracks are spreading, the boss will telegraph either a donut or point-blank AoE as well as cast either **Front Combination** or **Rear Combination**.
The inner ring of the donut is the size of the boss's hitbox, and the outer limit of the point-blank is smaller than max melee.

The boss will use **Outside Roundhouse** (donut) or **Inside Roundhouse** (point-blank) at exactly the same time as the AoEs explode from the cracks.
The snapshotting on these AoEs is quite generous.
Shortly after the first set of AoEs go off, the boss will use **Swinging Kick** to do a 180° cleave either in front of (for **Front Combination**) or behind (for **Rear Combination**) it.
There is enough time to cross over from a safe spot on the other side of the boss before the **Swinging Kick**.

As the second set of cracks from **Archaic Rockbreaker** explode, the boss will use either **Outside Roundhouse** or **Inside Roundhouse**, whichever it did not use the first time.
The second roundhouse has no telegraph.

Finally, the boss will cast **Archaic Demolish**, a 3-person telegraphed stack, on each healer, and then **Ascendant Fist** again before ending the phase.

## Phase 3: Chimera 1

During the **Ravening** cast, new walls will appear around the arena, exactly as happens for **Archaic Rockbreaker**.

After **Ravening**, Kokytos casts **Levinstrike Summoning**.
This does no damage and causes four lightning orbs to appear in front of the four walls.

The boss then casts **Scrambled Succession** (aka Limit Cut 1).
During the cast, numbered markers will appear over players and the orbs.

The four orbs will be numbered 1-3-5-7 in a circle, either clockwise or counterclockwise.
Four players will randomly be numbered 2-4-6-8.
The remaining four players will not be numbered.

After **Scrambled Succession** completes, the boss disengages and becomes untargeable.
A blue AoE targeting marker will appear above a player's head who was not targeted by one of the numbered marks.

The boss will repeat the following four times, with 5-6 seconds between them.

1.  Another player, who has not yet received a marker this phase, will receive a blue targeting marker.
    (This is skipped on the last iteration because all players have received markers.)
1.  The boss jumps behind the next orb (#1 on the first repeat, #3 on the second, etc.).
1.  The boss kicks the orb towards the opposite wall.
    When the orb hits the wall, a small explosion kills any players standing too close.
    A tower appears where the orb hit the wall.
1.  Simultaneously:
    1.  The next player with a blue marker will be hit by **Icemeld**. (First blue marker on the first repeat, second blue marker on the second repeat, etc.)
        This is an extremely large circular AoE, with a diameter equal to exactly half of the arena's radius.
        **Icemeld** inflicts a 13-second *Magic Vulnerability* debuff.
    1.  The boss charges towards the next player in numeric order (#2 on first repeat, #4 on second repeat, etc.) and hits them with **Pile Pyre**, a small fire AoE.
        **Pile Pyre's** damage decreases the farther the player is from where the boss begins the charge.
        Too close, and it will likely be lethal.
        **Pile Pyre** inflicts a 9-second *Magic Vulnerability* debuff.
    1.  The tower explodes.
        If there is a player standing in the tower, that player takes light damage and receives a 7-second *Magic Vulnerability* debuff.
        If there is no player standing in the tower, everyone is hit by heavy damage and a debuff I can't remember.

After the final repeat of the above sequence, the boss reappears in the center of the arena, becomes targetable, and begins casting **Two Minds** followed up shortly by **Gluttony's Augur** raidwide.

## Phase 4: Beast

After **Ravening**, the boss will cast **Charybdis**.
Four circular AoE telegraphs will appear on the cardinals or intercardinals.
Tornadoes will appear in those telegraphs and remain there as danger zones for the remainder of the phase.
I don't actually know what happens if you go in them. I think it's a DoT? But don't do it.

Kokytos then casts **Comet**.
Four proximity telegraphs will appear at the cardinal/intercardinal spots not occupied by tornadoes.
If standing in the middle of the arena, the impact hits as a heavy raidwide.
Too close to any of the telegraphs is lethal.

**Comet** will cause a rock to appear at each of the telegraphs.
Two rocks will be intact, and two will be cracked.
If a rock is hit by any of the boss's attacks in the following segment, it will crack or, if already cracked, break.

The boss then casts **Beastly Bile**, a damageless cast, followed by **Thunderbolt**.
When **Thunderbolt** completes, the four players closest to the boss will be targeted by a cone-shaped AoE originating from the boss.
**Thunderbolt** inflicts a *Lightning Vulnerability* debuff.
Immediately after **Thunderbolt**, the player farthest from the boss will be hit by **Beastly Bile**, a 3-person stack AoE inflicting a *Dark Vulnerability* debuff.
The boss repeats the **Thunderbolt** cast, followed by another **Beastly Bile** hit.
These repeats behave exactly the same as the first set, but there is no second **Beastly Bile** castbar.

A red marker will appear over one of the remaining rocks, and the boss will cast **Ecliptic Meteor**.
If there is only one intact rock remaining, I have always witnessed **Ecliptic Meteor** target that rock.
If there are no intact rocks, **Ecliptic Meteor** targets the boss.
**Ecliptic Meteor** will kill any player who is not hiding behind an intact rock.
Note that you must have the rock between you and the meteor, not between you and the boss.

After **Ecliptic Meteor**, any remaining rocks will explode with a large circular AoE and the boss will cast **Beastly Fury**.
**Beastly Fury** inflicts heavy raidwide damage.

## Phase 5: Chimeric 2

During **Ravening**, walls appear for **Archaic Rockbreaker**.
The boss then casts a **Duality of Death** tankbuster.

**Archaic Rockbreaker** begins.
There are no cleaves this time.
Instead, as the first set of cracks on the floor light up, the boss will begin casting **Dualspell** with fire and ice.
The enhanced element will flash just before the second set of cracks explodes, giving little time to get into position for the stack.
**Dualspell** is followed up by a **Gluttony's Augur** raidwide.

The boss then casts **Chimeric Succession** (aka Limit Cut 2).
Four players will be marked with the numbers 1 through 4.
Unlike **Scrambled Succession**, the numbers this time are targeted based on difference from the boss.
The #1 marker goes to the player furthest from the boss, #2 to the player second furthest, etc.
This allows the targeted players to be agreed upon in advance.

Two different things proceed simultaneously:

1. The boss begins casting **Front Firestrikes** or **Rear Firestrikes**.
   1.  When the cast completes, the boss charges towards a random (?) player who didn't receive a marker earlier, hitting them with **Pile Pyre**.
       This **Pile Pyre** is a stack AoE that inflicts damage scaled based on the boss's travel distance.
       The farther the distance traveled, the less damage it deals.
       **Pile Pyre** inflicts an 8-second *Magic Vulnerability*.
   1.  Kokytos turns to face one of the players (unknown if it's the targeted player or a random unmarked player).
   1.  The boss then casts **Swinging Kick**, doing a 180° cleave in front (for **Front Firestrikes**) or behind (for **Rear Firestrikes**).
1. The four marked players are hit, in succession, by **Icemeld**.
   The first hit occurs about halfway through the **Front/Rear Firestrikes** castbar, and each subsequent hit is 3 seconds after the previous.
   The last hit is moments before **Swinging Kick**.
   **Icemeld** inflicts heavy damage and an 18-second *Magic Vulnerability*.

To end the phase, the boss centers and casts **Two Minds**.

## Phase 6: Mage 2

This phase is the victory lap.

After **Ravening**, the boss begins by casting **Dualspell** with thunder and ice.
Immediately afterwards, it casts **Gluttony's Augur**.

Then it casts **Dualspell** with fire and ice, followed by **Duality of Death** tankbusters.

Finally it casts **Dualspell** with thunder and ice again, this time the opposite pattern from the first cast of the phase.

For the enrage, boss will cast **Ravening** one final time, entering a brief final Chimeric phase.
It will then cast **Disintegrate**, which wipes the party when it completes.
