# Party Finder Glossary

###### Any chest

In a current Savage fight, the number of reward chests is based on the party members' weekly progress in the current tier. "Any chest" means the party just wants a clear and is not picky about the number of reward chests.

###### Blind

Going into a fight without knowing anything about it in advance. Someone going into a flight blind intends to learn it as they go.

###### C41

Short for "clear for one" or "carry for one". Means that the party is specifically to get one person a clear, often a friend of the party leader. May request that other players know the fight well.

###### Cleanup

Practicing a mechanic (or fight) that players have passed, but not consistently.

###### Enrage to clear

A group of players that have already made it to the enrage mechanic at the end of the fight and is focused on improving execution and DPS in order to pass the DPS check.

A player should not join a prog party if they haven't yet seen the enrgage mechanic.

###### Farm

The party intends to clear the fight repeatedly to get loot.
Unless the posting says otherwise, farm parties generally assume that players can consistently clear the fight.
But for some fights, clearing them may be very easy with an unsynced party.

###### Fresh

The party has players going in for the first time, but not necessarily [blind](#blind).

###### MINE

Short for "minimum item level, no echo".
Means the party will use the "Minimum item lvl sync" and "Silence echo" options to give the fight a difficulty similar to when it was current.

###### No spoilers

Playing a fight [blind](#blind), without even help from players who know the fight, figuring it out as they go.

If a PF posting says "no spoilers", players who have seen the fight are typically welcome to join, provided they don't offer any pointers or advice about the fight.

###### Practice

A party aiming to practice or learn a mechanic or the whole fight, without a specific goal of clearing.
Practice parties typically are lower pressure than other parties.

For current Savage fights, some players may want to explicitly *avoid* clearing, in order to preserve eligibility for the weekly reward.
Practice parties that want to avoid clearing should make explicit note of this in the posting and in chat so that everyone is on the same page.

###### Prog

Short for "progression", refers to learning a mechanic. For instance, "akh morn prog" would mean that the party members have gotten as far as akh morn and are currently learning to clear it.

A player should not join a prog party if they can't consistently clear mechanics up to that point of the fight, not counting mechanics marked for cleanup in the posting.

###### Reclear

For players who have already cleared the fight and can comfortably do so again.
Players still struggling with mechanics should strongly consider making/joining a party explicitly labeled as a cleanup/practice party,
rather than joining a party simply labeled "reclear".

###### Synced

Means that an older fight will *not* be played [unsync](#unsync).

###### Two chests

In a current Savage fight, the number of reward chests is based on the party members' weekly progress in the current tier.
"Two chest" means that all party members are expected to be eligible for a reward chest so that the maximum of two reward chests appears.
To be eligible for a reward chest, a player must have neither cleared the fight nor entered a later fight in the same tier.

###### Unsync

Means the fight will be played with the "unrestricted party" option so that level sync will be disabled and, if applicable, the Epic Echo buff will be in effect.
