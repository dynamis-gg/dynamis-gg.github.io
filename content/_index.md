## What is DESU?

DESU is a community aiming to build up the Party Finder experience on Dynamis,
and to provide a wealth of resources for everyone looking to tackle any and all
of the high-end combat content this game has to offer - together.

This site is a bit bare-bones at the moment, apologies for that. Very much a
work in progress! The source code is hosted on
[GitHub](https://github.com/dynamis-gg/dynamis-gg.github.io); contributions are
very welcome.

## Our main objectives

1. Getting into endgame content, Savage especially, can be daunting.
DESU wants to be a place where players who are new to all this can feel they
have a safe place to ask questions and be happily welcomed into the community!

2. Many of us came to Dynamis in hopes of building a different and more
   consistent Party Finder culture from the rest of NA, by taking inspiration
from the best parts of each region's approach to content.
For example, by establishing baseline conventions, standardizing names for
strategies, and ditching the "clock spot dance" for macros that take your
specific role into account across different fights.
We hope this will help the entire data center focus more on what's happening,
and less on arguing and trying to remember strats

3. Especially as our DC finds its legs, finding groups can be hard.
DESU helps folks get in touch - whether you're searching for pick-up groups,
trying to get stuff unlocked, or seeking people to play with on a more regular
basis.
